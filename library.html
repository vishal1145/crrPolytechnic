                There is a Central Library with more than 32,130 books at present meeting the requirements
                of all branches of Engineering. The Library is equipped with glass almirahs for the display of
                all textbooks subject-wise and discipline-wise. The library provides very comfortable seating
                place for the students and faculty to make self-study in a very calm and quite atmosphere.
                Both national and International journals were also procured for the updating of knowledge in
                different Engineering fields.
