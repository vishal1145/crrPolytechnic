            There is a Central Library with more than 32,130 books at present meeting the requirements
            of all branches of Engineering. The Library is equipped with glass almirahs for the display of
            all textbooks subject-wise and discipline-wise. The library provides very comfortable seating
            place for the students and faculty to make self-study in a very calm and quite atmosphere.
            Both national and International journals were also procured for the updating of knowledge in
            different Engineering fields.
