            SIR CATTAMANCHI RAMALINGA REDDY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS
        </p>
        <p>
            In the 1940s there was a long felt need for a full fledged college in the Head
            Quarters of West Godavari District. This need was fulfilled when late Sri Rao
            Saheb Damaraju Venkata Rao, the then chairman of the Municipal Council, Eluru,
            took the initiative in 1944. The Municipal Council under his stewardship enlisted
            the sympathy and support of the philanthropic citizens in and around Eluru and
            embarked on a collection drive and deposited Rs.2 lakh 17 thousand in the
            Municipal Treasury as an earmarked fund for the starting of the college.
        </p>
        <p>
            The college was inaugurated on 4th July 1945 by Sir Cattamanchi
            Ramalinga Reddy, the distinguished educationist and the then Vice Chancellor,
            Andhra University and the college was named after him as &quot;Sir C.R.Reddy
            Municipal College&quot;. It started functioning as a second grade college, with Sri.
            Subrahmanyam as the Founder Principal.
        </p>
        <p>
            A constitution was adopted for the Governing Body in the year 1947,
            according to which the word &quot;Municipal&quot; was dropped from the original name of
            the college. The name of the College was treated as an institution under Private
            Management by the Government from 1947.
        </p>
        <p>
            The College was raised to the status of First Grade with effect from July
            1951 when the University granted affiliation for B.Sc Physics (Main) and B.Com
            Courses. The College was granted further affiliation in Degree Courses for B.A.
            (Mathematics) and B.A. which were started in July 1954.
        </p>
        <p>
            The College opened the Pre-University course with effect from July 1957
            and three Year Degree Course from June 1958. Subsequently two year
            Intermediate course was started in the year 1969-70. Degree course under the New
            Scheme with one main and two ancillaries was introduced from the academic year
            1971.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the help of the philanthropic benefactors, the infrastructure of the
            college was developed and the Management then felt it proper to start Post
            Graduate Courses in the College, which were started in the year 1971, followed by
            Evening College for the employees who wish to improve their qualification.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Management sincerely felt that the opening of Law Course in the
            Evening College would help improve the qualification of many graduates. As a
            result BL Course was started in evening college in 1976-77 and in Day College in
            1980.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Management was of the view that some technical and professional courses
            should be started to provide better employment avenues for the students of this
            region. <b>This dream came true when they started a Polytechnic in 1980.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Management&#39;s desire to start a College of Education to train and mould
            the graduates into ideal teachers took shape in 1984 when B.Ed Course was started.
            A Public School was started by the Management with the intention of providing
            better educational facilities to the children of this town.
        </p>
        <p>
            The College has become a premier educational institution in Andhra
            Pradesh. It has grown to be a Mini-University. Considering the all round

            development and the infrastructural facilities available in the college, the
            Management was encouraged to apply for the conferment of the Autonomous
            status and on May 11, 1987 the U G C accorded the status of autonomy to Sir
            C.R.Reddy College.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Management started a Women&#39;s College in 1987 to cater to the needs of
            the growing women population in and around Eluru, seeking higher education.
            Realizing that there is a great demand for engineering education in these parts the
            Management started an Engineering College in 1989.
        </p>
        <p>
            Keeping in view the demand in Pharmaceutical Sciences, the Management
            started Sir C.R.Reddy College of Pharmaceutical Sciences in November 2007.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sri Alluri Bapineedu had been the President of the Governing Body for
            about three decades and was mainly responsible for the phenomenal growth and
            development of the college. He had been a source of strength and inspiration to the
            Management, Principal, staff and students. Sri A S Chowdary stepped into the
            shoes of his father in 1992. Sri VVN Prasad acted as Correspondent and SecretaryÂ 
            for more than two decades and involved himself actively in the smooth
            administration bringing out the growth and development of our institutions till
            2003. Later, Sri Gutta Subba Rao acted as secretary till the end of the tenure of the
            committee. In 2007, the Managing Committee of Sir C.R.Reddy Group of
            Institutions took charge. Sri Kommareddy Rambabu and Sri Kakarala Rajendra
            Vara Prasada Rao took charge as President and Secretary respectively.In 2010 Sri
            Chava Rama Krishna Rao, an educationist and a veteran politician took charge as
            President and Sri Kakarala Rajendra Vara Prasada Rao was reelected as Secretary.
            The present Governing Body under the dynamic leadership of Sri Alluri Indra
            Kumar took office. We hope the present body with its rich and varied experience
            and strong commitment would certainly sustain its growth and development and
            add many more feathers in its cap in the coming years with Dr MBSV Prasad as
            Secretary.
