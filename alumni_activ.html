        <p>
            One of the activities of the Association is to arrange, invite Guest lectures by the Alumni for the final year students. The Lecture shall be
            pertaining to the relevant topics of all disciplines of students in a rotation manner. Alumni employed in foreign countries like United States etc,
            Dubai are very much interested in visiting the college and sharing their experience.
            This helps in a great way for our young Diploma passed out engineers to get to know the various avenues available for Job. This also
            another way for our students to know about the various non-formal continuing Education Programmers especially in Professional fields. The
            Alumni Association acts as a liaison between employed experienced engineers with fresh Diploma holders.
            Separate committees consisting Alumni members are formed to monitor the regular activities of arranging invited lectures for Polytechnic
            College students and to publish newsletter.
            Department Associations are constituted for each department with one or two alumni as a member.
