            <p>It is my pleasure to present my panorama regarding 34 years of my journey
                with this pioneer technical institute, a tycoon of its kind in the entire state of
                Andhra Pradesh. Having established a long-long back in 1980, the institute stood
                as “CREATOR” for so many “FOLLOWERS” in the field of Technical education.</p> <br>
            <p>Under the umbrella of “SIR CRR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS” a
                conglomerate of educational institutions, this Polytechnic is maintained with rapt
                attention to formulate technicians enriched with present industry need skills.</p><br>
            <p>We run this polytechnic with a mission to provide a stream of quality
                professionals from rural and urban to cater the requirements of industry and man
                power. We are with a vision to transform every student into industrial leaders and
                our polytechnic is the center of excellence in the field of technical education. We
                send our faculty to faculty development programs to be updated with the latest
                knowledge.</p><br>
            <p>To fulfill our goals as a learning community we insist that the objectives of
                students learning are not compromised. We treat all the students equitably and our
                student learning achievements are based on academic performances. We make the
                students ready for job and ready for life.</p><br>
            <p>“Education is a social process; education is growth, education is not a
                preparation for life but is life itself”.
