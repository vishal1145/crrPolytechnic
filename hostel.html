        <p>
            Students are accommodated in beautiful living havens. In a sharp
            departure from the normal concept of dormitory where a group of students
            are lumped in a huge hall, only four students are placed in the rooms, with
            attached rest room facilities. There are separate dormitories for boys and
            girls, each of them maintained by a Wardens and Matron. The sanitary
            blocks are clean, well maintained and have 24 -hour supply of hot and cold
            water.
