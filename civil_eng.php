                        Civil Engineering Department was established in 2020.The Department offers diploma program in Civil Engineering with an annual intake of 60+60=120 students. The faculty is rich blend of experienced professionals from the academia and the industry. The Department is equipped with nine full-fledged Laboratories engaged in Research and Consultancy apart from regular academics. Industry specific training programmes, invited talks, workshops and industrial visits are organized by the Department for better employability, building confidence and for overall development of the students.

                    Civil engineering is the oldest and one of the most versatile branches of engineering. Every structure that we see around today is a creation of civil engineering. Civil engineers design, construct, supervise, operate, and maintain large construction projects and systems, including roads, buildings, airports, tunnels, dams, bridges, and systems for water supply and sewage treatment. Many civil engineers work in design, construction, research, and education.
