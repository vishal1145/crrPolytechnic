                    <li class="myclass">The American novelist, James A. Michener, said: “Scientists dream about doing great things. Engineers do them.” This is certainly the case with mechanical engineers. These guys are the people that create and build the machines, tools, equipment and mechanical devices that make the world go round. Sounds pretty important, doesn’t it?</li>
                    <li class="myclass">Mechanical engineering is one of the broadest specialist subsectors in the world of engineering. The skills of mechanical engineers are needed in a huge range of industries, such as robotics, aerospace, defence, manufacturing and civil engineering.</li>
                    <li class="myclass">Mechanical engineers use their creativity, technical skills, practical abilities and scientific knowledge to design, manufacture and maintain every kind of mechanical device imaginable: from small components, such as precise medical devices (e.g. pacemakers), to large machinery, such as cooling systems in nuclear power plants and jet engines in aeroplanes. Their expertise is essential throughout the research, design, planning, production, testing, installation and maintenance of mechanical devices.</li>
