            Water supplied at sir c r r polytechnic is highly safe and free from bacterial
            contamination. The water is drawn from the college bore wells and taken
            through a purifier and softener and again back to the purifier before finally
            being kept in a cooler for drinking or kitchen for cooking purposes.
            Safeguards include regulated ozonisers at all outlets, while filtration and
            purification takes place at a sophisticated plant with digested controls.
