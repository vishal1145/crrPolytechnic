               <b> Future job scope of Electronics & Communication Engineering –</b> Studying electronics and 
               communication engineering is the dream of every second aspirant due to a number of reasons – growth, 
               job opportunities, salary range and continuous industry growth. One of the broad engineering fields, 
               Electronics and Communication involves the transmission of information across channels like coax cable 
               or optical fiber or radio link.
            </p><br>
            <p>Electronics and Communication engineering is one of the most popular engineering branches out there. 
               Electronics and Communication involves the transmission of information across channels like coax cable 
               or optical fiber. Candidates have good opportunities in this field. This field is applied in the area 
               of designing equipment’s such as routers, switches, fiber optics and electronic switching systems. Graduates 
               in Electronics and communication Engineering also have lots of opportunities in Government and private companies 
               in the areas of design, manufacture, installation, operation, and maintenance of electronics equipment and systems. 
               In a nutshell, ECE branch of engineering deals with electronic devices and software interfaces. The degree which 
               is more helpful to the candidate to develop their skills towards programming and analytical zone. So it is 
               compatible for engineering aspirants. Upon completion of the degree, candidates can choose to work in consumer 
               electronics, electricity generation and distribution, transportation, aviation and avionics, computer 
               applications, radio and television, telecommunications, manufacturing and offshore industries. Nowadays 
               the recent growth in advanced technologies, most of the industries are beginning to adopt robotics, 
               automation technologies, artificial intelligence, smart energy systems, Internet of Things (IoT) into 
               their process, and also penetrated into different areas like healthcare, instrumentation, automation, 
               remote sensing, signal processing etc.</p><br>
               <p>So students pursuing electronics and communication engineering have a lot of scope in varied industries.</p>
